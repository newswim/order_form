          1. Introduction and Scope
        </h4>
        <p>
          SAVI Controls, LLC. ("SAVI Controls") sells hardware products (the
          "Hardware") and software, either embedded in the Hardware or distributed
          separately (the "Software" and together with the Hardware, the "SAVI
          Server"). SAVI Controls also owns and operates the websites located at
          www.savicontrols.com and other related SAVI Controls web pages (the
          "Website"), and provides access to certain internet and software
          application services related to the use and operation of SAVI Server.

          Limited Warranty provided with your Hardware (the "Warranty") sets forth
          the terms of the limited warranty that applies to the Hardware. A copy of
          the Warranty is available at www.savicontrols.com/legal/warranty, and a
          copy of the EULA is available at www.savicontrols.com/legal/eula.

        </p>
        <h4>
          4. Third-Party Content
        </h4>
        <p>
          The Software and Services may give you the ability to access content,
          such as music or video services, television or other material, controlled
          or provided by third parties ("Third-Party Content"). You understand and
          acknowledge that: (a) Third-Party Content remains the property of the
          applicable third parties, who have the sole right to determine your
          rights to use such content; (b) SAVI Controls is not responsible for, and
          has no editorial control over, any Third-Party Content, and SAVI Controls
          does not sponsor or endorse any such content; and (c) SAVI Controls has
          no control over the distribution of Third-Party Content. You agree that
          SAVI Controls will have no liability to you or to any third parties,
          including without limitation to anyone else who uses your SAVI Server,
          related to or arising out of to any Third-Party Content. You also agree
          that neither the Software and Services will not be used to illegally
          copy, display or otherwise make use of Third-Party Content without
          authorization from the appropriate rights holder or in violation of
          applicable law. Unauthorized copying or distribution of copyrighted or
          trademarks may constitute an infringement of the copyright or trademark
          holders' intellectual property rights. In addition, steps intended to
          defeat or bypass security measures designed to prevent infringement of
          the intellectual property rights of others may be illegal under U.S. law
          or comparable foreign laws. SAVI Controls reserves the right to terminate
          your right to access and use the Software and Services and delete your
          account if SAVI Controls believes in good faith that you have used the
          Software and Services or your SAVI Server to infringe upon the
          intellectual property rights of others.
        </p>
        <h4>
          5. Internet Service Provider Charges
        </h4>
        <p>
          Access to and use of the Software and Services requires the use of, and
          you are responsible for, an always-on broadband Internet connection. SAVI
          Controls is not responsible for and does not make any assurances about
          the availability or functionality of any broadband Internet connection.
          Network protection for your Internet connection is strongly advised to
          protect your SAVI Server against viruses and other types of harm. You are
          responsible for any service charges for your Internet connection incurred
          as a result of using or accessing the Website and/or the Software and
          Services and acknowledge and agree that you shall be solely responsible
          for all disputes with any Internet service provider related to the same.

          You represent and warrant to SAVI Controls that: (a) you have provided or
          will provide SAVI Controls with User Information that is correct and
          complete; (b) you will not use the Software and Services in violation of
          any applicable laws, regulations, or ordinances or for any illegal or
          unauthorized activities; (c) you take full responsibility for the actions
          of anyone to whom you disclose your password or login ID or whom you
          otherwise allow to access your account; and (d) you will never

        <h4>
          7. Dealers Are Independent Contractors, Not Agents of SAVI Controls
        </h4>
        <p>
          You are required to purchase your SAVI Server System from an authorized
          SAVI Controls dealer ("Dealer") in your area of your choice. While such
          Dealers receive training regarding SAVI Server, Dealers are independent
          contractors and service providers, and not employees or agents of SAVI
          Controls. Accordingly, (i) SAVI Controls makes no representations or
          warranties with respect to Dealers or their services and is in no way
          responsible for their acts or omissions, and (ii) Dealers have no right
          to bind SAVI Controls legally or otherwise make commitments on behalf of
          SAVI Controls. You are solely responsible to select a competent Dealer
          that meets your expectations. Such Dealer may offer additional
          installation, configuration or ongoing maintenance services. Any
          disputes, which may arise between you and your Dealer, are to be resolved
          between you and your Dealer.
        </p>
        <h4>
          8. Term and Termination
        </h4>
        <p>
          These Terms will remain in full force and effect so long as you continue
          to use or access the Software, Website and/or the Services, or until
          terminated in accordance with the provisions of this section. You may
          terminate your account and your right to use the Software and Services
          for any reason, at any time. Your access to the Software and Services and
          your account will be terminated upon your written or emailed request and
          any unused Subscription Fees that you have paid are nonrefundable. At any
          time SAVI Controls may suspend or terminate your rights to use the
          Software and Services, if SAVI Controls in good faith believes that you
          have used the Software and Services in violation of this Agreement. If
          you transfer or assign your SAVI Server or any portion thereof to a new
          owner, your right to use the Software and Services with respect to such
          products automatically terminates, and the new owner will have no right
          to use the Software and Services under your account (as described below),
          and will be required to register for a separate account with SAVI
          Controls. In addition, SAVI Controls reserves the right to terminate your
          Software and Services account and this Agreement for any reason or no
          reason, if SAVI Controls gives you at least thirty (30) days advance
          notice of such termination. Upon any such termination of your account by
          SAVI Controls, you will remain obligated to pay all outstanding fees and
          charges relating to your use of the Software and Services prior to
          termination, but SAVI Controls will return any unused Subscription Fees
          that you have paid if Your account is terminated for any reason other
          than Your breach of this Agreement.
        </p>
        <h4>
          9. Ownership
        </h4>
        <p>
          You acknowledge that all right title and interest in and to the Software
          and Services, including all intellectual property rights therein and
          thereto, remain the exclusive property of SAVI Controls and its
          licensors, and this Agreement grants to you no right or interest therein
          other than the limited rights expressly set forth herein, and SAVI
          Controls and its licensors and suppliers reserve all rights not granted
          in this Agreement.
        </p>
        <h4>
          10. Your Indemnification of SAVI Controls
        </h4>
        <p>
          You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless SAVI Controls, and its
          officers, directors, employees, consultants, agents, and other
          representatives, from and against any and all suits, claims, actions,
          proceedings, damages, demands, injuries, liabilities, losses, costs and
          expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), arising from or related
          to: (a) your negligence or willful misconduct; (b) your use of the
          Software and Services; (c) your breach of any of your representations,
          warranties, obligations, or covenants in this Agreement; and (d) your use
          of Third-Party Content.

          12. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
        </h4>
        <p>

          16. Governing Law and Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial
        </h4>
        <p>
          This Agreement and any claims arising hereunder will be governed by the
          laws of the State of Texas, excluding principles of conflict or choice of
          law. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
          Sale of Goods does not apply to these Terms. To the extent permitted by
          applicable law, you and SAVI Controls hereby irrevocably submit to the
          jurisdiction of any Texas state court or United States federal court, in
          either case sitting in Texas over any suit, action or other proceeding
          brought by you, a third party, or SAVI Controls arising out of or
          relating to these Terms, and you and SAVI Controls hereby irrevocably
          agree that all claims with respect to any such suit, action or other
          proceeding shall be heard and determined in such courts. THE PARTIES
          HEREBY UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF
          ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OUT OF,
          RELATED TO, OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE PERFORMANCE OR BREACH OF
          THIS AGREEMENT, AND/OR THE RELATIONSHIP THAT IS BEING ESTABLISHED AMONG
          THEM. The scope of this waiver is intended to be all encompassing of any
          and all disputes that may be filed in any court or other tribunal
          \(including, without limitation, contract claims, tort claims, breach of
          duty claims, and all other common law and statutory claims). THIS WAIVER
          IS IRREVOCABLE, MEANING THAT IT MAY NOT BE MODIFIED EITHER ORALLY OR IN
          WRITING, AND THE WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS,
          RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS, OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT, AND RELATED
          DOCUMENTS, OR TO ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS OR AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THIS
          TRANSACTION OR ANY RELATED TRANSACTION. In the event of litigation, this
          Agreement may be filed as a written consent to a trial by the court.

          17. Miscellaneous
        </h4>
        <p>
          This Agreement represents the entire agreement between you and SAVI
          Controls with respect to your use, and SAVI Controls’ provision, of the
          Website and the Software and Services, and its terms supersede and
          replace any prior or contemporaneous written or oral statements by SAVI
          Controls or its representatives, dealers, or resellers. If any provision
          of this Agreement is held by a court to be invalid or unenforceable under
          applicable law, such provision will be deemed modified to the extent
          necessary to render such provision valid and enforceable, and the other
          provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. The
          official text of this Agreement or notice submitted hereunder shall be in
          English. In the event of any dispute concerning the construction or
          meaning of this Agreement, reference shall be made only to this Agreement
          as written in English and not to any translation into another language,
          and this Agreement will not be construed against the drafting party. You
          may not amend this Agreement except in a writing signed by SAVI Controls.
          You may not assign, sublicense or transfer any of your rights and
          obligations under this Agreement to a third party without SAVI Controls’
          prior written consent. Any attempted assignment, sublicense, or transfer
          without the prior written consent of SAVI Controls shall be null and
          void. SAVI Controls’ failure to enforce any of the terms of the terms and
          conditions of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver or
          relinquishment of SAVI Controls’ right to do so at any time. Sections
          4(b), 5, 9, and 11 - 16 shall survive any termination or expiration of
          this Agreement.
