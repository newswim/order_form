        1. YOUR PRIVACY MATTERS
      </h4>
      <p>
        SAVI Controls, LLC (“SAVI Controls”, “we”, or “us”) understands that you care
        about how information about you is collected and used. We respect your
        privacy and we are committed to protecting the personal information that you
        share with us. This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of SAVI
        Controls with respect to our products, services and websites (including
        www.savicontrols.com&nbsp;or other websites, online services, or applications
        operated or controlled by SAVI Controls, collectively the "Sites"). We
        outline the types of information SAVI Controls collects, how we collect it,
        how we use it, and the options you have to restrict the collection and use of
        your personally identifiable information.
      </p>
      <p>
        By using SAVI Controls’ products, services or Sites you signify your
        acceptance of SAVI Controls’ collection and use of your personal information
        in the manner and for the purposes described herein. If you do not agree to
        some aspect of SAVI Controls’ intended use of your information, you may use
        one or more of the methods described in this Privacy Policy to opt out of the
        specific type of collection or use of information. If you feel that these
        methods are insufficient to alleviate your concerns, please do not use our
        products, services, or Sites or otherwise provide SAVI Controls with your
        personal information.
      </p>
      <h4>
        2. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION
      </h4>
      <p>
        SAVI Controls may collect information about you any time you are in contact
        with SAVI Controls, its products, services or Sites. SAVI Controls may share
        this personal information with our subsidiaries and affiliates (and vice
        versa) but only for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <h5>
        A. Information You Provide
      </h5>
      <p>
        We may ask you to provide personal information when you visit our Sites, use
        our products, register for a program or service, subscribe to a newsletter,
        respond to a survey, fill out a form, or in connection with other activities,
        services, features or resources we make available to you from time to time.
        We may ask you for: your name, title or position, email address, mailing
        address, phone number, financial information, and other personal information
        as appropriate. Additionally, we may request information about the SAVI
        Controls products you use, or third-party products connected to your SAVI
        Controls system, such as model or serial numbers. In the case of a technical
        issue, we may also collect information relating to a support or service
        incident. Please note that we do not intentionally collect any sensitive
        personal information relating to confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic
        origins, political or religious beliefs or sexuality; please do provide any
        of this type of information to us.
      </p>
      <h5>
        B. Information Collected Automatically
      </h5>
      <p>
        To measure and improve the performance of our Sites, we may collect
        information during your visit to the Sites through our automatic data
        collection tools, which may include Web beacons, cookies, embedded Web links,
        pixel tags and other commonly used information-gathering tools. These tools
        help us track how users are interacting with our Sites, and help us make your
        visit to our Sites easier and more efficient by providing you with a
        customized experience and recognizing you when you return. SAVI Controls
        maintains its own pages on many social networking sites, and we may also
        collect information from you when you interact with our social networking
        pages.
      </p>
      <h5>
        C. Use of Cookies and Other Web Tracking Technologies
      </h5>
      <p>
        A "cookie" is a small piece of data stored on a user's device. When you visit
        the Sites, SAVI Controls may place a "cookie" on your device which allows us
        to compile information about Sites usage and to recognize you when you visit
        the Sites again. In addition, we use pixel tags "tiny graphic images " to
        tell us what parts of our Sites our users have visited or to measure the
        effectiveness of searches performed on our Sites. This information can be
        used to enhance the content of the Sites and make your experience more
        informative. Pixel tags also enable us to send email messages in a format
        that users can read and tell us whether emails have been opened to help
        assure that we're only sending messages that are of interest to our users. If
        you subsequently provide us with your personal information, such as your
        email address, we will associate our cookies and tags with that information
        and you will no longer be an anonymous visitor to the Sites.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some of our email messages we use a "click-through URL" linked to content
        on the Sites. When a user clicks one of these URLs, they pass through our web
        server before arriving at the destination web page. We track this
        click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and
        measure the effectiveness of our communications. If you prefer not to be
        tracked this way, simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in our email
        messages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like many other companies, we use third party partners to analyze data
        collected about your browsing behavior when you visit our Sties. Our Sites
        may include technology from Flurry Analytics, Google Analytics, Quantcast,
        Elaqua, Hubspot and other similar technologies. These tools provide us with
        analytical information, reports and analysis about the use of our Sites, and
        may record the internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your device to
        the Internet, the type of device and operating system you are using, your
        general geographic information, as well as events that occur within our Site,
        such as the page that led you to our Sites, how often you visit pages within
        our Sites and other data related to the use of our Sites. We may also use
        these tools to help serve content that is relevant to you. For more
        information about these services and the related privacy policies and options
        available to you, please visit the websites of our analytics service
        providers listed above. If you wish to avoid SAVI Controls’ use of these
        analytics services on our Sites, you may use any opt-out mechanisms provided
        by our analytics providers and/or actively manage the settings on your
        browser or mobile device to delete and disable cookies and other
        tracking/recording tools.
      </p>
      <h5>
        D. Do Not Track Features
      </h5>
      <p>
        Some web browsers may let you enable a "do not track" feature that sends
        signals to the websites you visit, indicating that you do not want your
        online activities tracked. This is different than blocking or deleting
        cookies, as browsers with a "do not track" feature enabled may still accept
        cookies. There is currently no industry standard for how companies should
        respond to "do not track" signals, although one may develop in the future. We
        do not respond to "do not track" signals at this time. If we do so in the
        future, we will update our Privacy Policy and describe to describe our
        response. More information about "do not track" is available at
        www.allaboutdnt.org. The only way to completely opt out of the collection of
        any information through cookies or other tracking technology is to actively
        manage the settings on your browser or mobile device to delete and disable
        cookies and other tracking/recording tools.
      </p>

        connected devices; your zip code or time zone; and other information about

        time, frequency and type of use of the various components your system, a
        history of your device settings including any adjustments you make, data from
        any sensors built into the SAVI Controls system or the products you integrate
        into the system, the type of media player and media you are using, etc. This
        project--specific data may be stored along with any account information you
        provide when you set up an account with SAVI Controls including your email
        and other contact information. We use this information to help us customize

        comfortable and secure.

        1. Introduction and Scope
      </h4>
      <p>
        SAVI Controls, LLC. ("SAVI Controls") sells hardware products (the
        "Hardware") and software, either embedded in the Hardware or distributed
        separately (the "Software" and together with the Hardware, the "SAVI
        Server"). SAVI Controls also owns and operates the websites located at
        www.savicontrols.com and other related SAVI Controls web pages (the
        "Website"), and provides access to certain internet and software
        application services related to the use and operation of SAVI Server.
      </p>
      <p>
        These Terms of Use, together with the SAVI Controls privacy policy, form
        a binding legal agreement between you and SAVI Controls, LLC (the
        "Agreement") that sets forth the terms and conditions under which SAVI
        Controls agrees to make the Software, Website and the Services available
        to you and which govern your use of the Software, Website and the
        Services provided to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the avoidance of doubt, the SAVI Controls End User License Agreement
        between you and SAVI Controls (the "EULA") sets forth the terms and
        conditions that apply to your use of any Software, and the SAVI Controls
        Limited Warranty provided with your Hardware (the "Warranty") sets forth
        the terms of the limited warranty that applies to the Hardware. A copy of
        the Warranty is available at www.savicontrols.com/legal/warranty, and a
        copy of the EULA is available at www.savicontrols.com/legal/eula.

        You should periodically check the Website for the most current version of
        these Terms. If you are dissatisfied with any such changes to these
        Terms, your sole recourse will be to cease use of the Software and the
        Services or any portion thereof, in accordance with Section 9 below.

        additional features and functionality that SAVI Controls may, in its sole
        discretion and from time to time, offer to you. SAVI Controls may, in its

      <p>
        <b>(c) IN ADDITION, IN NO EVENT DOES SAVI CONTROLS AUTHORIZE YOU OR
        ANYONE ELSE TO USE THE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES WHERE THE FAILURE OF THE
        SOFTWARE AND SERVICES TO PERFORM CAN REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO RESULT IN
        SIGNIFICANT PHYSICAL INJURY, OR IN LOSS OR PROPERTY, OR IN LOSS OF LIFE.
        ANY SUCH USE IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK, AND YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY AND

        <b>(d) Modification. SAVI Controls reserves the right, at any time, to
        modify, suspend, or discontinue the Software and Services or any part
        thereof, with or without notice. You agree that SAVI Controls will not be
        liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or
        discontinuance of the Software and Services or any part thereof.</b>
      </p>
      <h4>
        4. Third-Party Content
      </h4>
      <p>
        The Software and Services may give you the ability to access content,
        such as music or video services, television or other material, controlled
        or provided by third parties ("Third-Party Content"). You understand and
        acknowledge that: (a) Third-Party Content remains the property of the
        applicable third parties, who have the sole right to determine your
        rights to use such content; (b) SAVI Controls is not responsible for, and
        has no editorial control over, any Third-Party Content, and SAVI Controls
        does not sponsor or endorse any such content; and (c) SAVI Controls has
        no control over the distribution of Third-Party Content. You agree that
        SAVI Controls will have no liability to you or to any third parties,
        including without limitation to anyone else who uses your SAVI Server,
        related to or arising out of to any Third-Party Content. You also agree
        that neither the Software and Services will not be used to illegally
        copy, display or otherwise make use of Third-Party Content without
        authorization from the appropriate rights holder or in violation of
        applicable law. Unauthorized copying or distribution of copyrighted or
        trademarks may constitute an infringement of the copyright or trademark
        holders' intellectual property rights. In addition, steps intended to
        defeat or bypass security measures designed to prevent infringement of
        the intellectual property rights of others may be illegal under U.S. law
        or comparable foreign laws. SAVI Controls reserves the right to terminate
        your right to access and use the Software and Services and delete your
        account if SAVI Controls believes in good faith that you have used the
        Software and Services or your SAVI Server to infringe upon the
        intellectual property rights of others.
      </p>
      <h4>
        5. Internet Service Provider Charges
      </h4>
      <p>
        Access to and use of the Software and Services requires the use of, and
        you are responsible for, an always-on broadband Internet connection. SAVI
        Controls is not responsible for and does not make any assurances about
        the availability or functionality of any broadband Internet connection.
        Network protection for your Internet connection is strongly advised to
        protect your SAVI Server against viruses and other types of harm. You are
        responsible for any service charges for your Internet connection incurred
        as a result of using or accessing the Website and/or the Software and
        Services and acknowledge and agree that you shall be solely responsible
        for all disputes with any Internet service provider related to the same.
      </p>
      <h4>
        6. Certain of Your Representations and Warranties to SAVI Controls
      </h4>
      <p>

        will provide SAVI Controls with User Information that is correct and
        complete; (b) you will not use the Software and Services in violation of
        any applicable laws, regulations, or ordinances or for any illegal or
        unauthorized activities; (c) you take full responsibility for the actions
        of anyone to whom you disclose your password or login ID or whom you
        otherwise allow to access your account; and (d) you will never

        Controls security measures in connection with the Software and Services.
      </p>
      <h4>
        7. Dealers Are Independent Contractors, Not Agents of SAVI Controls
      </h4>
      <p>
        You are required to purchase your SAVI Server System from an authorized
        SAVI Controls dealer ("Dealer") in your area of your choice. While such
        Dealers receive training regarding SAVI Server, Dealers are independent
        contractors and service providers, and not employees or agents of SAVI
        Controls. Accordingly, (i) SAVI Controls makes no representations or
        warranties with respect to Dealers or their services and is in no way
        responsible for their acts or omissions, and (ii) Dealers have no right
        to bind SAVI Controls legally or otherwise make commitments on behalf of
        SAVI Controls. You are solely responsible to select a competent Dealer
        that meets your expectations. Such Dealer may offer additional
        installation, configuration or ongoing maintenance services. Any
        disputes, which may arise between you and your Dealer, are to be resolved
        between you and your Dealer.
      </p>
      <h4>
        8. Term and Termination
      </h4>
      <p>
        These Terms will remain in full force and effect so long as you continue
        to use or access the Software, Website and/or the Services, or until
        terminated in accordance with the provisions of this section. You may
        terminate your account and your right to use the Software and Services
        for any reason, at any time. Your access to the Software and Services and
        your account will be terminated upon your written or emailed request and
        any unused Subscription Fees that you have paid are nonrefundable. At any
        time SAVI Controls may suspend or terminate your rights to use the
        Software and Services, if SAVI Controls in good faith believes that you
        have used the Software and Services in violation of this Agreement. If
        you transfer or assign your SAVI Server or any portion thereof to a new
        owner, your right to use the Software and Services with respect to such
        products automatically terminates, and the new owner will have no right
        to use the Software and Services under your account (as described below),
        and will be required to register for a separate account with SAVI
        Controls. In addition, SAVI Controls reserves the right to terminate your
        Software and Services account and this Agreement for any reason or no
        reason, if SAVI Controls gives you at least thirty (30) days advance
        notice of such termination. Upon any such termination of your account by
        SAVI Controls, you will remain obligated to pay all outstanding fees and
        charges relating to your use of the Software and Services prior to
        termination, but SAVI Controls will return any unused Subscription Fees
        that you have paid if Your account is terminated for any reason other
        than Your breach of this Agreement.
      </p>
      <h4>
        9. Ownership
      </h4>
      <p>
        You acknowledge that all right title and interest in and to the Software
        and Services, including all intellectual property rights therein and
        thereto, remain the exclusive property of SAVI Controls and its
        licensors, and this Agreement grants to you no right or interest therein
        other than the limited rights expressly set forth herein, and SAVI
        Controls and its licensors and suppliers reserve all rights not granted
        in this Agreement.

      <h4>
        10. Your Indemnification of SAVI Controls
      </h4>
      <p>
        You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless SAVI Controls, and its
        officers, directors, employees, consultants, agents, and other

        to: (a) your negligence or willful misconduct; (b) your use of the
        Software and Services; (c) your breach of any of your representations,
        warranties, obligations, or covenants in this Agreement; and (d) your use
        of Third-Party Content.

      </h4>
      <p>
        IN NO EVENT WILL SAVI CONTROLS OR ANY OF ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO YOU

        written certification of such destruction, of any confidential information
        provided to the other party. Each party further agrees that monetary damages
        may not alone be a sufficient remedy for unauthorized disclosure of
        confidential information and that the non-disclosing party shall be entitled
        to seek all remedies and damages available in law and equity, including but
        not limited to such injunctive relief as may be deemed proper by a court of

        all claims arising from DEALER negligence or willful misconduct, and from
        DEALER breach of this AGREEMENT including making any false or misleading
        statements about PRODUCT. SAVI agrees to give DEALER prompt written notice of
        any such claims, to tender the defense to DEALER, cooperate fully with any
        investigative or other requests, and to grant DEALER the right to control
        settlement and resolution. DEALER agrees to pay all costs finally awarded by

        17. GENERAL
      </h5>
      <p>
        <i>a.) Relationship of the Parties:</i> The relationship between the parties
        shall be that of independent contractors. Nothing herein shall be construed
        as creating or constituting any agency or employment relationship,
        partnership, or joint venture between the parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>b.) Governing Law, Jurisdiction:</i> This AGREEMENT shall be governed by
        and interpreted under the laws of the State of Texas. SAVI and DEALER
        expressly consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and
        federal district courts located in Dallas, TX.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>c.) Enforceability:</i> If any provision of this AGREEMENT is held to be
        unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be
        more narrowly and equitably construed so that it becomes legal and
        enforceable or if such construction is not possible, then the provision shall
        be deemed removed, and in either case the entire Terms shall not fail on
        account thereof and the balance of the Terms shall continue in full force and
        effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>d.) No Waiver:</i> Any of the provisions of this AGREEMENT may be waived
        by the party entitled to the benefit thereof. Neither party will be deemed,
        by any act or omission, to have waived any of its right or remedies hereunder
        unless such waiver is in writing and signed by the waiving party, and then
        only to the extent specifically set forth in such writing. A waiver with
        reference to one event will not be construed as continuing or as a bar to or
        waiver of any other right or remedy, or as to a subsequent event.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>e.) Counterparts and Electronic Signature:</i> This AGREEMENT may be
        executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
        original but all of which together will constitute, and have the same force
        and effect as, one and the same instrument or an original executed document.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>f.) Entire Terms, Amendments:</i> This AGREEMENT contains the entire
        AGREEMENT between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and
        supersedes and replaces all prior agreements, negotiations and oral
        understandings, if any. This AGREEMENT may not be amended, supplemented, or
        modified in any way, except by an amendment in writing and signed by
        authorized representatives of the parties. No amendment shall be effected by
        the acknowledgment or acceptance of a purchase order, invoice, or other forms
        stipulating additional or different terms. This AGREEMENT shall inure to the
        benefit of and be binding upon each of the parties and their respective
        successors, assigns, heirs, executors, administrators, and trustees. <i>g.)
        Equitable Relief:</i> The parties agree that a breach of Section 8
        CONFIDENTIALITY of this AGREEMENT, or of any provision affecting the
        ownership of the SAVI IP <i>(intellectual property)</i> shall result in
        immediate and irreparable harm for which ordinary damages may not be a
        sufficient remedy. Therefore, the parties agree that in the event of any such
        breach, the non-breaching party may seek equitable relief, including without
        limitation an injunction or other restraint, in any court of competent
        jurisdiction, without the necessity of posting any bond, in addition to any
        other relief to which such non-breaching party may be entitled at law or in
        equity.

        <i>i.) Survival:</i> The expiration or termination of this AGREEMENT shall
        not terminate vested rights of either party from any liabilities or
        obligations incurred under this AGREEMENT prior to or which by their nature
        are intended to survive expiration or termination, including but not limited
        to provisions relating to confidentiality, indemnification, and proprietary
        rights.
