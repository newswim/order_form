        <h4>
          1. YOUR PRIVACY MATTERS
        </h4>
        <p>
          SAVI Controls, LLC (“SAVI Controls”, “we”, or “us”) understands that you care
          about how information about you is collected and used. We respect your
          privacy and we are committed to protecting the personal information that you
          share with us. This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of SAVI
          Controls with respect to our products, services and websites (including
          www.savicontrols.com&nbsp;or other websites, online services, or applications
          operated or controlled by SAVI Controls, collectively the "Sites"). We
          outline the types of information SAVI Controls collects, how we collect it,
          how we use it, and the options you have to restrict the collection and use of
          your personally identifiable information.
        </p>
        <p>
          By using SAVI Controls’ products, services or Sites you signify your
          acceptance of SAVI Controls’ collection and use of your personal information
          in the manner and for the purposes described herein. If you do not agree to
          some aspect of SAVI Controls’ intended use of your information, you may use
          one or more of the methods described in this Privacy Policy to opt out of the
          specific type of collection or use of information. If you feel that these
          methods are insufficient to alleviate your concerns, please do not use our
          products, services, or Sites or otherwise provide SAVI Controls with your
          personal information.
        </p>
        <h4>
          2. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION
        </h4>
        <p>
          SAVI Controls may collect information about you any time you are in contact
          with SAVI Controls, its products, services or Sites. SAVI Controls may share
          this personal information with our subsidiaries and affiliates (and vice
          versa) but only for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <h5>
          A. Information You Provide
        </h5>
        <p>
          We may ask you to provide personal information when you visit our Sites, use
          our products, register for a program or service, subscribe to a newsletter,
          respond to a survey, fill out a form, or in connection with other activities,
          services, features or resources we make available to you from time to time.
          We may ask you for: your name, title or position, email address, mailing
          address, phone number, financial information, and other personal information
          as appropriate. Additionally, we may request information about the SAVI
          Controls products you use, or third-party products connected to your SAVI
          Controls system, such as model or serial numbers. In the case of a technical
          issue, we may also collect information relating to a support or service
          incident. Please note that we do not intentionally collect any sensitive
          personal information relating to confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic
          origins, political or religious beliefs or sexuality; please do provide any
          of this type of information to us.
        </p>
        <h5>
          B. Information Collected Automatically
        </h5>
        <p>
          To measure and improve the performance of our Sites, we may collect
          information during your visit to the Sites through our automatic data
          collection tools, which may include Web beacons, cookies, embedded Web links,
          pixel tags and other commonly used information-gathering tools. These tools
          help us track how users are interacting with our Sites, and help us make your
          visit to our Sites easier and more efficient by providing you with a
          customized experience and recognizing you when you return. SAVI Controls
          maintains its own pages on many social networking sites, and we may also
          collect information from you when you interact with our social networking
          pages.
        </p>
        <h5>
          C. Use of Cookies and Other Web Tracking Technologies
        </h5>
        <p>
          A "cookie" is a small piece of data stored on a user's device. When you visit
          the Sites, SAVI Controls may place a "cookie" on your device which allows us
          to compile information about Sites usage and to recognize you when you visit
          the Sites again. In addition, we use pixel tags "tiny graphic images " to
          tell us what parts of our Sites our users have visited or to measure the
          effectiveness of searches performed on our Sites. This information can be
          used to enhance the content of the Sites and make your experience more
          informative. Pixel tags also enable us to send email messages in a format
          that users can read and tell us whether emails have been opened to help
          assure that we're only sending messages that are of interest to our users. If
          you subsequently provide us with your personal information, such as your
          email address, we will associate our cookies and tags with that information
          and you will no longer be an anonymous visitor to the Sites.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some of our email messages we use a "click-through URL" linked to content
          on the Sites. When a user clicks one of these URLs, they pass through our web
          server before arriving at the destination web page. We track this
          click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and
          measure the effectiveness of our communications. If you prefer not to be
          tracked this way, simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in our email
          messages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like many other companies, we use third party partners to analyze data
          collected about your browsing behavior when you visit our Sties. Our Sites
          may include technology from Flurry Analytics, Google Analytics, Quantcast,
          Elaqua, Hubspot and other similar technologies. These tools provide us with
          analytical information, reports and analysis about the use of our Sites, and
          may record the internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your device to
          the Internet, the type of device and operating system you are using, your
          general geographic information, as well as events that occur within our Site,
          such as the page that led you to our Sites, how often you visit pages within
          our Sites and other data related to the use of our Sites. We may also use
          these tools to help serve content that is relevant to you. For more
          information about these services and the related privacy policies and options
          available to you, please visit the websites of our analytics service
          providers listed above. If you wish to avoid SAVI Controls’ use of these
          analytics services on our Sites, you may use any opt-out mechanisms provided
          by our analytics providers and/or actively manage the settings on your
          browser or mobile device to delete and disable cookies and other
          tracking/recording tools.
        </p>
        <h5>
          D. Do Not Track Features
        </h5>
        <p>
          Some web browsers may let you enable a "do not track" feature that sends
          signals to the websites you visit, indicating that you do not want your
          online activities tracked. This is different than blocking or deleting
          cookies, as browsers with a "do not track" feature enabled may still accept
          cookies. There is currently no industry standard for how companies should
          respond to "do not track" signals, although one may develop in the future. We
          do not respond to "do not track" signals at this time. If we do so in the
          future, we will update our Privacy Policy and describe to describe our
          response. More information about "do not track" is available at
          www.allaboutdnt.org. The only way to completely opt out of the collection of
          any information through cookies or other tracking technology is to actively
          manage the settings on your browser or mobile device to delete and disable
          cookies and other tracking/recording tools.

          comfortable and secure.
