          <i>a.) Term:</i> This AGREEMENT will be effective for an initial term
          commencing on the date that this AGREEMENT is executed by SAVI and continuing

          13. INDEMNIFICATION
        </h5>
        <p>
          <i>a.) By SAVI:</i> SAVI will indemnify, defend, and hold DEALER, and its
          agents and employees, harmless from and against any and all claims, actions,
          liabilities, losses, costs and expenses (a "claim") arising from <i>(i)</i> a
          PRODUCT recall, whether initiated by SAVI or a valid order by a court or
          other governmental body; <i>(ii)</i> claims that the PRODUCTS or any SAVI
          Content infringe, misappropriate or injure a third party's intellectual
          property or proprietary rights; and <i>(iii)</i> false or misleading PRODUCT
          specifications provided to DEALER to promote and sell the PRODUCTS. DEALER

          to SAVI, and to grant SAVI the right to control settlement and resolution.
          SAVI agrees to pay all costs of liability, settlement and defense, including
          its attorney fees and costs. If it deems appropriate to limit or reduce its
          potential liability arising from a claim, SAVI may cause DEALER to limit,
          suspend or terminate distribution of any PRODUCT or PRODUCTS, in one or more
          territories or countries, pending resolution of the claim provided; however
          that in the event of a suspension or termination of distribution pursuant to
          the foregoing, SAVI will accept a return of, and will reimburse DEALER at the
          price paid for DEALER existing inventory of suspended or terminated PRODUCT.
          Furthermore, if SAVI receives written notice of an alleged infringement or
          believes that a claim of infringement is likely, SAVI may at its sole option
          and expense: <i>(1)</i> procure for DEALER the right to continue to use
          PRODUCT at SAVI's sole expense; <i>(2)</i> modify SAVI's PRODUCT so that it
          no longer infringes; <i>(3)</i> replace the infringing portion of PRODUCT
          with material(s) that do not infringe, or <i>(4)</i> terminate this
          AGREEMENT.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>b.) By DEALER:</i> DEALER will indemnify, defend, and hold SAVI, its
          parent, affiliates, agents and employees harmless from and against any and
          all claims arising from DEALER negligence or willful misconduct, and from
          DEALER breach of this AGREEMENT including making any false or misleading
          statements about PRODUCT. SAVI agrees to give DEALER prompt written notice of
          any such claims, to tender the defense to DEALER, cooperate fully with any
          investigative or other requests, and to grant DEALER the right to control
          settlement and resolution. DEALER agrees to pay all costs finally awarded by
          a court of competent jurisdiction or agreed in a settlement of any such
          claim, including reasonable attorney fees and costs.

          This AGREEMENT and any rights or obligations hereunder may not be assigned by
          either party without first obtaining the other party's express written
          consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however,

          consent by DEALER to <i>(a)</i> a successor corporation resulting from a
          merger or consolidation or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of
          SAVI's assets or a majority, or controlling interest in SAVI's voting stock;

          15. FORCE MAJEURE
        </h5>
        <p>
          Neither party shall be in breach of this AGREEMENT solely due to causes
          beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of such party. Such
          causes may include, but are not restricted to, acts of God or of a public
          enemy, acts of the government in either its sovereign or contractual
          capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, freight
          embargoes, power failure, or failure of the customary delivery systems, but

          fault or negligence of the party failing to perform. Each party must inform
          the other of any force majeure event within five (5) business days after such
          party became aware of its occurrence, and within reason.

        </h5>
        <p>
          <i>a.) Relationship of the Parties:</i> The relationship between the parties
          shall be that of independent contractors. Nothing herein shall be construed
          as creating or constituting any agency or employment relationship,
          partnership, or joint venture between the parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>b.) Governing Law, Jurisdiction:</i> This AGREEMENT shall be governed by
          and interpreted under the laws of the State of Texas. SAVI and DEALER
          expressly consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and
          federal district courts located in Dallas, TX.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>c.) Enforceability:</i> If any provision of this AGREEMENT is held to be
          unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be
          more narrowly and equitably construed so that it becomes legal and
          enforceable or if such construction is not possible, then the provision shall
          be deemed removed, and in either case the entire Terms shall not fail on
          account thereof and the balance of the Terms shall continue in full force and
          effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>d.) No Waiver:</i> Any of the provisions of this AGREEMENT may be waived
          by the party entitled to the benefit thereof. Neither party will be deemed,
          by any act or omission, to have waived any of its right or remedies hereunder
          unless such waiver is in writing and signed by the waiving party, and then
          only to the extent specifically set forth in such writing. A waiver with
          reference to one event will not be construed as continuing or as a bar to or
          waiver of any other right or remedy, or as to a subsequent event.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>e.) Counterparts and Electronic Signature:</i> This AGREEMENT may be
          executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
          original but all of which together will constitute, and have the same force
          and effect as, one and the same instrument or an original executed document.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>f.) Entire Terms, Amendments:</i> This AGREEMENT contains the entire
          AGREEMENT between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and
          supersedes and replaces all prior agreements, negotiations and oral
          understandings, if any. This AGREEMENT may not be amended, supplemented, or
          modified in any way, except by an amendment in writing and signed by
          authorized representatives of the parties. No amendment shall be effected by
          the acknowledgment or acceptance of a purchase order, invoice, or other forms
          stipulating additional or different terms. This AGREEMENT shall inure to the
          benefit of and be binding upon each of the parties and their respective
          successors, assigns, heirs, executors, administrators, and trustees. <i>g.)

          CONFIDENTIALITY of this AGREEMENT, or of any provision affecting the
          ownership of the SAVI IP <i>(intellectual property)</i> shall result in
          immediate and irreparable harm for which ordinary damages may not be a
          sufficient remedy. Therefore, the parties agree that in the event of any such
          breach, the non-breaching party may seek equitable relief, including without
          limitation an injunction or other restraint, in any court of competent
          jurisdiction, without the necessity of posting any bond, in addition to any
          other relief to which such non-breaching party may be entitled at law or in
          equity.

          not terminate vested rights of either party from any liabilities or
          obligations incurred under this AGREEMENT prior to or which by their nature
          are intended to survive expiration or termination, including but not limited
